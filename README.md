# EBC gh0st

This is the repo containing my PoC presented at REcon 2025.
EBC gh0st is the first universal UEFI EBC exploit with a graphical payload.
Building upon my work writing the first EBC UEFI virus (EBC frnknstn)[https://github.com/ic3qu33n/EBC-frnknstn], EBC gh0st extends viral functionality to deliver a graphical payload.
Additional features of EBC gh0st:
• Implements a custom BMP parser written in EBC which parses BMP image files, executes BMP image read/write operations and performs the necessary conversions for pixel values to/from packed uint32 pixel representations required of the UEFI Graphics Output Protocol (GOP). 


The slidedeck of my REcon 2025 talk can be found in the Talk slides are in the (Back-from-the-dead-Exhuming-EBC repo)[https://github.com/ic3qu33n/Back-from-the-dead-Exhuming-EBC].
